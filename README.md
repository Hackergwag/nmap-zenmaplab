<h1>Enumerating A Network With Nmap And Zenmap</h1>

 ### [Video Tutorials Explaining Nmap And Zenmap In Details](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dhbddxsyo2rvkcf/MOBK5174+(1).mp4/file)

<h2>Description</h2>
As a cybersecurity professional, the project demonstrates the use of Nmap and Zenmap, powerful network scanning tools, to discover devices and services operating on a local network. Network scanning is a critical practice in cybersecurity, as it helps identify potential targets and vulnerabilities that could be exploited within a network.

In this project, Nmap and Zenmap are utilized to:

Identify Open Ports: By scanning the network, these tools reveal which ports are open on various devices. Open ports can be entry points for attackers, making it essential to identify and secure them.

Conduct Network Scans: These tools perform comprehensive scans to map out the devices connected to.

Conduct Operating System Scan: These tools can run an operating system type of scan.
